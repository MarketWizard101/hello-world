# hello-world
My first repository 

Greetings, Laurence here. I'm a 3rd year CS & Math student, with an interest in algorithmic design. My university studies have focused on JS and Python, but I'd also like to venture into low level languages. I aim to work in the finance sector, with an ideal job of a quant delevoper/analyst/researcher.
